		<h1>Planet Mythology</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This website is intended to make it easier to see what gods have been associated with the planets in the night sky across the world and through documented human history. It is my perspective that people throughout history projected complex images / archetypes, personified in "gods", upon the planets. Joseph Campbell once said something along the lines of, "dreams are personal myths, myths are the collective dream". It is illuminating to see the similarities and differences between cultures in their associations with a given planet. I believe that it reveals something about our collective psyche to learn about the mythologies of people around the world.</p>
		<p>Currently this website is mostly an index of Wikipedia pages, though more will be added in the future!</p>
