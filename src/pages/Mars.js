		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares" target="_blank">Ares - Greek</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">The Greek god of courage and war. The Greeks were ambivalent toward him. He embodies the physical valor necessary for success in war but can also personify sheer brutality and bloodlust, in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose martial functions include military strategy and generalship. An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.</p>

		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belatucadros" target="_blank">Belatucadros - Celtic</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">A deity worshipped in Celtic northern Britain, particularly in Cumberland and Westmorland. In the Roman period he was identified with Mars and appears to have been worshipped by lower-ranked Roman soldiers as well as by Britons. In five inscriptions he is called Mars Belatucadrus and the name is frequently translated as "fair shining one" or "fair slayer."</p>

		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cariocecus" target="_blank">Cariocecus - Iberian</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">The god of war in the mythology of various Iberian tribes, in the region then known as Hispania. Through conquest and cultural overlay, he became syncretised with the Ancient Rome god Mars and the Ancient Greek god Ares.</p>

		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocidius" target="_blank">Cocidius - Britain</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">A deity worshipped in northern Britain. The Romans equated him with Mars, god of war and hunting, and also with Silvanus, god of forests, groves and wild fields.</p>

		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laran" target="_blank">Laran - Etruscan</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">In Etruscan mythology and religion, Laran (or Larun) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_deities" target="_blank">the god of war</a>. In art, he was portrayed as a naked youth wearing a helmet, a cuirass and carrying a spear, shield, or lance. Laran also appears to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic" target="_blank">underworld god</a>. Among his attributes is his responsibility to maintain peace. According to some scholars, he also seems to have been the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_deity" target="_blank">guardian of boundaries</a> as shown by the boundary cippi found in Bettona with the inscriptions tular Larna and tular larns. Along with eight other Etruscan gods, he can wield lightning.</p>

		<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangala" target="_blank">Mangala - Hindu</a></p>
		<p className="godDescription">God of anger. He is painted red or flame colour, four-armed, carrying a trident (Sanskrit: trishūla), mace (Sanskrit: gadā), lotus (Sanskrit: Padma) and a spear (Sanskrit: shūla. His mount (Sanskrit: vahana) is a ram.</p>

			<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars" target="_blank">Mars - Greek</a></p>
			<p className="godDescription">The god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. The most prominent of the military gods in the religion of the Roman army. Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming.</p>

			<p className="godLink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars" target="_blank">Nergal - Mesopotamia</a></p>
			<p className="godDescription">Especially closely related to war, disease and the underworld, and according to <a href="https://vu-nl.academia.edu/FransWiggermann" target="_blank">Frans Wiggermann</a> can be understood as "god of inflicted death." However, Nergal's warlike nature also made him a god defending the realm, whose presence was regarded as necessary for peace - in this role he was known under the title Lugal-Silimma ("The lord of peace"). He was invoked in apotropaic rituals as well, as his fearsome reputation was believed to keep houses safe from evil.</p>
